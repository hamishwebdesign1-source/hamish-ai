# HamishAI — decisions log

One entry per real product/technical decision worth a future reader knowing
the reasoning behind, not just the outcome. Newest first. Every specialist
agent should add an entry here when they make a call that isn't obvious from
the code alone — the same instinct as this codebase's own inline comments,
just at product-decision scope instead of line scope.

## 2026-08-27 — Set up the AI product team; corrected `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Decision**: Built a 7-agent specialist team (`.claude/agents/`) plus a
`/mission` orchestrator skill and this shared-memory folder, rather than
one general-purpose agent handling everything.

**Why**: A single agent doing strategy, design critique, implementation, and
QA on the same turn tends to rubber-stamp its own work — "the code works,
therefore we're finished" without a genuinely separate pass asking "is this
actually good?" Separate specialists with separate system prompts (and
explicit instructions to *not* automatically agree) give a real review
chain instead.

**Also found and fixed while setting this up**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
explicitly stated *"There is deliberately no `organisations` table separate
from `clients`"* — no longer true. The entire `/studio` Agency Platform
layer (multi-tenant orgs, platform billing, Command Centre, 13 cron jobs
not 5) had been built with no corresponding update to this file. Corrected
in place rather than left to keep misleading the next reader (human or
agent). `docs/RUNBOOK.md` has the same class of drift (still describes 5
cron jobs) and has not yet been fixed — flagged in
`PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md`'s "known real gaps."

**Not built**: standalone Market/Competitor Research and Content/Marketing
agents — no real recurring workload for either yet (see
`docs/ai-team/README.md`'s team table). Revisit if one shows up.
